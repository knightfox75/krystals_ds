The main objective of the game is to create groups of 3 or more gems of the
same color in any direction. A greater number of stones removed in the same
movement, more score. Your mission is to get as many points as possible
before reaching the last level of the game (25). After the game, the
score will receive bonuses for the level achieved, the maximum combo
made and if you've reached the last level of the game.

the ground, all the gems change color randomly.

gem, all gems of that color will be eliminated. If a white gem touches the
ground, the elimination of all the gems from the board.
