* Final release.

- Version 20130921
* Slow down a little max speed to make game easier beyond Lv15.
* Fixed but that causes gems floats in the mid of the air if
  you move it just in the autodrop frame.  
  

- Version 20130829
* Added sparkle effect on gems.


- Version 20130823
* Totaly rewrited all routines of gem elimination. This will bugfix some
  extrange cases and improve stability.


- Version 20130820
* Added some DC_FlushRange(); to ensure data is write down from cache to ram
